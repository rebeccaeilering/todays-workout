        <li>
          <h2>Arm Circles</h2>
          <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and extend your arms parallel to the floor. Circle your arms forward using small controlled motions, gradually making the circles bigger until you feel a stretch in your triceps. Reverse the direction of the circles after about 10 seconds.</p>

        <li>
          <h2>Back Extensions</h2>
          <p>Lie on a mat on your stomach and straighten your legs behind you. Place your elbows on the ground and slide your shoulders down. Lift your upper back, pressing your hips into the mat. Keep your head and neck neutral. Hold for 30 seconds. Lower to starting position.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Bear Crawl</h2>
          <p>Start on all fours and lift your knees so they’re at a 90-degree angle and hovering an inch off the ground. Keep your back flat, your legs hip-width apart and your arms shoulder-width apart. Move one hand and the opposite foot forward an equal distance while staying low to the ground. Switch sides, moving the opposite hand and foot. Repeat the movement while alternating sides.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Bird Dog</h2>
          <p>Kneel with knees hip-width apart and your hands firmly placed on the ground about shoulder-width apart. Practice lifting one hand and the opposite knee just an inch or two off the floor while balancing on the other hand and knee and keeping your weight centered. When you feel steady and ready to move on to full range of motion, point the arm out straight in front and extend the opposite leg behind you. You should form one straight line from your hand to your foot, keeping hips squared to the ground. Hold for a few seconds then return your hands and knees to the starting position.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Box Jumps</h2>
          <p>Stand in front of the box with your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend into a quarter squat and swing your arms back, then swing them forward and explode up off the ground. Land on the box as softly as possible. Then jump back down. Again, you’re aiming to land as softly as possible. You can also opt to step down slowly one leg at a time, which will work the glutes even more and safeguard your joints.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Box Toe-Taps</h2>
          <p>Stand in front of a step, box (plyo-boxes work great), platform, or BOSU ball that is at least 10 to 12 inches tall. Arms remain at your sides. Raise your right foot and place the ball of your foot on the platform. Push off the ground with your left foot and switch legs mid-air, with your left foot now touching the platform and your right foot on the ground. Repeat alternating toe taps slowly until you feel comfortable with the movement pattern, and your technique is correct.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Burpees</h2>
          <p>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, weight in your heels, and your arms at your sides. Push your hips back, bend your knees, and lower your body into a squat. Place your hands on the floor directly in front of, and just inside, your feet. Shift your weight onto your hands. Jump your feet back to softly land on the balls of your feet in a plank position. Your body should form a straight line from your head to heels. Jump your feet back so that they land just outside of your hands. Reach your arms over head and explosively jump up into the air. Land and immediately lower back into a squat for your next rep.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Crab Walk</h2>
          <p>Begin by sitting on the floor with your feet hip-distance apart in front of you and your arms behind your back with fingers facing hips. Lift hips off the floor and tighten your abs. Start "walking" forward by moving your left hand followed by your right foot; and then your right hand followed by your left foot. Walk four or more steps as space allows, then walk back. Continue back and forth for desired amount of time.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Dead Bug</h2>
          <p>Allow your shoulders and lower back to fall heavy to the floor. Draw your shoulders down away from your ears. To get into the starting position, lift your hands so your elbows are above your shoulders with your fists facing in toward each other. Lift your legs so your knees are directly over your hips. On an exhale, slowly lower your right arm and left leg until they’re just above the floor. On an inhale, bring them back to the starting position. Repeat on the opposite side.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Donkey Kick</h2>
          <p>Assume the starting position on all fours: knees hip-width apart, hands under your shoulders, neck and spine neutral. Bracing your core, begin to lift your right leg, knee staying bent, foot staying flat, and hinging at the hip. Use your glute to press your foot directly toward the ceiling and squeeze at the top. Ensure your pelvis and working hip stay pointed toward the ground. Return to the starting position.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Dumbell Thrusters</h2>
          <p>Use an overhand grip to hold a barbell/dumbbells and stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Your hands should also be shoulder-width apart. Your hands should also be shoulder-width apart. Draw your shoulders back and down. Keep your spine in alignment. Keep a slight bend in your knees. Refrain from locking them. Your feet should be under the bar. Slowly bring the barbell up to your collarbones or above your shoulders. Bring your elbows underneath or facing forward. Engage your core and expand your chest as you slowly lower your body into a deep squat position. Drop your glutes lower than parallel to the ground if you’re flexible enough, as though you’re sitting. Engage your core and turn out your knees slightly for stability. Press your heels and the outside of your feet into the floor and bring your elbows up as you quickly and powerfully explode to return to standing. When your hips are nearly in alignment for standing, engage your glutes, press your heels into the floor, and extend the bar overhead. Straighten your arms and extend your head forward so that your ears come in front of your biceps. Slowly lower the bar to collarbone height and repeat the movement in a continuous motion.</p>

        <li>
          <h2>Fire Hydrant</h2>
          <p>Start on your hands and knees. Place your shoulders above your hands and your hips above your knees. Tighten your core and look down. Lift your left leg away from your body at a 45-degree angle. Keep your knee at 90 degrees. Lower your leg to starting position to complete 1 rep.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Half Kneeling Wood Chop</h2>
          <p>Place a cable pulley at the highest position, attach a rope handle, grip both ends of the rope so that the thumbs are pointed up to the ceiling, and lower body into a kneeling position. Kneel so that the left knee is on the floor and the right foot on the ground keeping the pulley on the right side of the body. Keep the back straight while pulling the rope down to the chest then pushing it down in front of the left hip and turning the hands away from each other (do not allow the upper body to move while bringing the resistance across the body.) At the bottom of the movement pause for one second before slowly reversing the motion to return the weight to its original starting position.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Inchworm</h2>
          <p>Start standing with feet hip-width apart. Hinge forward at your hips and place your palms on the mat. You can bend your knees if needed to get your palms flat on the floor. Walk your hands forward so that you’re in high plank. Your shoulders should be stacked directly above your wrists. Walk your hands back toward feet and stand up. </p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Jack Knife</h2>
          <p>Begin your jackknife by lying on the ground, with your arms outstretched behind your head. Keep your arms and legs raised a little off the ground throughout the movement. That movement is a simple one to understand, if not to do. Contract your abs and fold in two, bringing your arms and legs together to meet above your midriff, before easing them back to your starting position.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Squat Press and Throw</h2>
          <p>Start with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a medicine ball at your chest. Lower into a squat position, as if sitting in an invisible chair. Once your legs reach 90 degrees, drive through your heels to jump up and throw the ball straight up. Catch and repeat.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Medicine Ball Roll Push Up</h2>
          <p>Begin in a plank position with right hand on top of medicine ball and left hand on the floor. Hands are directly below shoulders with arms long. Begin to lower chest toward the floor, bending your elbows and keeping body straight. (If this is too difficult, bend your knees and place them on the ground.) Press up to start position then roll the ball over to the left hand. Repeat the push-up with ball under left hand.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Medicine Ball Toe Touch</h2>
          <p>Begin on your back with legs together straight up above hips holding the medicine ball with two hands at your chest. Slightly curl chin forward, relaxing through the back of the neck. On an exhale, squeeze your abdominals to reach the ball up toward the toes to touch, then gently release back to start position.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Plank Jacks</h2>
          <p>Begin in a plank position with your shoulders over your wrists, your feet together, and your body in a straight line. Similar to the motion of a jumping jack, jump your feet wide keeping your buttocks down. Jump your feet back together.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Renegade Row</h2>
          <p>Begin in a full plank with dumbbells in hands, arms extended, and on toes. (kneeling variation is fine if you are not able to do a full plank) Engage your abdominals drawing the belly inward towards your spine. Pull right dumbbell up toward right hip bone keeping weight close to your side. Slowly return it to the floor and repeat with the left dumbbell.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Step Ups</h2>
          <p>To start, place your entire right foot onto the bench or chair. Press through your right heel as you step onto the bench, bringing your left foot to meet your left so you are standing on the bench. Return to the starting position by stepping down with the right foot, then the left so both feet are on the floor.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Updown Planks</h2>
          <p>Begin in a full plank. Lower your right elbow to the mat and then your left, coming into an elbow plank. Put your right hand on the mat, and straighten your right elbow. Do the same on the left to return to a full plank.</p>
          <!-- <p><a href="#" target="_blank">Link to example</a></p> -->
